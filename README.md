# HelpMeOut

## Overview
HelpMeOut is a job board application created to connect members of the community in a safe, accessible manner. Designed to answer a growing need, HelpMeOut is sure to help bridge those in need of work done around the house to those who have the qualifications to provide such a service.

## Description
HelpMeOut was an idea presented by a client, and implemented by a team of developers aiming to provide a premium product that met proposed criteria.
After account creation, users of HelpMeOut will be able to: post a job as a client needing provided services, or search for jobs as a contractor.   Contractors will be further prompted to select one or many specialties, and be required to provide supporting qualifications.
Jobs will be both searchable and filterable. Once a job has been claimed by a contractor, forms of communication will be established between the contractor and client to further discuss specifications of the job.
Upon completion of a job, the client will be able to review the contractor's work. This will allow subsequent users to pick contractors based on a peer-reviewed system of tranparency.
